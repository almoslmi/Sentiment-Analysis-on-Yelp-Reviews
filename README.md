# Sentiment Analysis and Keyword Mining on Yelp Reviews

This repo documents our work for the sentiment analysis and keyword mining on Yelp reviews. 

The goal of the project is to:

1) Build and validate machine learning models and natural language processing techniques to classify 4.7M Yelp reviews by 1.3M users for 157K businesses as positive os negative.

2) Mine top keywords in the reviews to explore the attributes of a given business and generate word cloud.

3) Deploy a data pipeline that automates the process of data storing, loading, querying, and modeling with SparkSQL and SparkML on various AWS instances.
